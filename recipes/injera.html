            <h4>Description:</h4>
            <p>A naturally fermented, spongy, gluten-free flatbread from Ethiopia is made from teff flour and water, using wild yeast to ferment over a couple of days. 
                It is then cooked like a crepe and turned into a flavorful, tangy bread to serve with your favorite Ethiopian food. 
                The fermentation process can take up to 2 or 3 days, depending on your climate. 
                Injera is typically served with vegetables and/or meat on top where the bread is actually an eating utensil.</p>
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 cup white teff flour</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup brown teff flour</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons white teff flour, divided, or as needed</li>
                    <li>1 cup water</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons water, divided, or as needed</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil (Optional)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>Steps:</h4>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mix 1/2 cup white teff flour and brown teff flour together in a bowl. 
                        Add 1 cup water and whisk well. 
                        Pour mixture into a glass container large enough to hold 3 times the original volume. 
                        Cover with cheesecloth or other breathable fabric to keep out dust; do not seal with plastic wrap as air circulation is vital. 
                        Leave covered container in a draft-free environment; the mixture needs air to be circulated in order to ferment. 
                        Stir batter 2 times over 24 hours.</li>
                    <li>
                        Check for bubbles and possibly an increase in volume after 24 hours; there may also be a slightly tangy and sour smell. 
                        When you notice these things, add 1 tablespoon white teff flour and 1 tablespoon water to the batter and whisk well. 
                        Check in a few hours to see if bubbles have again formed, mixture has increased in volume, and the pungent smell is still evident; if so, the batter is ready and you can skip to the cooking process (step 5).  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Leave batter to rest another 12 hours if the mixture has not begun to form or smell sour after the first 24 hours; stir once during this time. 
                        Check to see if bubbles have formed, mixture has increased in volume, and a pungent smell is evident; if so, proceed with step 4.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mix together 2 tablespoons white teff flour and 2 tablespoons water in a bowl, making sure there are no lumps. 
                        Add mixture to the batter, whisking well. 
                        Wait a few hours; batter should be bubbly with a noticeable increase in volume and a pungent but fragrant smell, indicating it is ready to be cooked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Heat an 8-inch crepe pan or nonstick skillet over medium heat. 
                        Add oil. 
                        Pour a scant 1/2 cup batter slowly and steadily into the hot pan in a circular motion from outside to inside. 
                        Cover the pan completely in a spiral without swirling. 
                        Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, allowing steam to cook the top of the bread, 1 to 3 minutes. 
                        Remove from pan with spatula and transfer to a plate; cover to keep warm. 
                        Repeat with remaining batter.
                    </li>
                </ol>
