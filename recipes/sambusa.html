                    <li>2 teaspoons ground cardamom</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon water, or as needed</li>
                    <li>1 (14 ounce) package spring roll wrappers</li>
                    <li>1 quart oil for frying, or as needed</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>Steps:</h4>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
                        Cook and stir onion, leek, and garlic in hot oil until onion is transparent. 
                        Add ground beef; cook and stir until still slightly pink and about halfway done. 
                        Season with cumin, cardamom, salt, and pepper; mix well. 
                        Continue cooking until beef is browned and crumbly. 
                        Remove the skillet from heat.</li>
                    <li>
                            Mix together flour and water in a small bowl to make a thin paste. 
                            Using one wrapper at a time, fold into the shape of a cone. 
                            Fill cone with beef mixture, close the top, and seal with paste. 
                            Repeat until wrappers or filling are used up.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 365 degrees F (170 degrees C). 
                        There should be enough oil to submerge sambusas. 
                        Fry sambusas, a few at a time, in hot oil until golden brown. 
                        Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
                    </li>

                </ol>
